Environmental Land Management Payments Methodology

The objective of this work is to identify and explore the most suitable options for a payment methodology to be used for England's new Environmental Land Management (ELM) system, to be launched in January 2024.

The payment methodology and rates will be applied to a National Pilot, which is to launch in 2021. The Pilot will allow the Government to review and refine the methodology ahead of the launch of the ELM system in 2024.

The payment methodology will be the framework for setting payments for land managers, and specifically refers to the methodology for calculating the payment rates offered for environmental outcomes achieved by land managers.
